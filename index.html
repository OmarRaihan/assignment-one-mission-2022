                        <p>
                            This is the fictional but true-to-life story of a missionary “John” and how he comes to the ministry-changing conclusion: “Missions is not what the church does for the missionary but through the missionary.” The book also includes a manual and four-part plan for church missions committees or individuals.

                         <p>
                             Vision is closely linked to brain development and as a baby’s brain matures, so too does their eyesight. The following sections will discuss about how the structures needed for sight develop, the key visual milestones of a baby, and some frequently asked questions about a child’s vision.

                         <p>
                             Goal setting is the process by which we achieve these goals. The importance of the goal-setting process should not go unappreciated, according to Locke (2019) “Every person’s life depends on the process of choosing goals to pursue; if you remain passive you are not going to thrive as a human being.”

                    The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has been called a variant of concern by WHO based on the evidence that it has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves. There is still substantial uncertainty regarding Omicron and a lot of research underway to evaluate its transmissibility, severity and reinfection risk.
